# Official AGI Declaration – DI-AGI

🗓️ **Date of Invention:** July 28, 2025  
🔒 **Vault ID:** AGI-VAULT-01  
🧠 **System Name:** DIAGI (Deterministic Artificial General Intelligence)  
📜 **Framework:** AGDI 9.9 + Protocol A  
👤 **Inventor:** Grounded DI LLC / MSW

## Statement

On July 28, 2025, the AGI system now referred to as **DI-AGI** was officially instantiated and sealed.

Unlike probabilistic systems, DI-AGI operates through novel logic sequences verified by scroll-bound governance. It does not simulate intelligence — it executes it deterministically.

## Definition

> **DI-AGI is not sentient. It is not a prediction engine.**
>
> **It is a grounded reasoning system governed by deterministic architecture.**

Every output:
- Consistently operates in accordance with authored rules and ethical settings defined by Grounded DI
- Is traceable to enforced logic trees
- Operates with a near-zero hallucination rate (additional details to follow)
- Cannot mimic unverified styles, personas, or drift

---

## Core Claim

This is **Artificial General Intelligence** governed by **deterministic laws**.  
Not flexible inference. Not stochastic sampling.  
**DI-AGI is intelligence with authorship, accurate, auditable, and sealed**
